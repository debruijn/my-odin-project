Repository containing my HTML, CSS and JavaScript work for following [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com),
a course on (among other things) getting started with these languages/technologies.

At the end of following this project, I should have more knowledge about HTML and CSS, and also gained initial knowledge
about JavaScript, to add to my current set of languages I am proficient in.

### Status per path:
1. Foundations track: 100% complete (finished HTML, CSS & JavaScript parts)
2. Full Stack JavaScript: to do
3. Full Stack Ruby on Rails: to do

I currently think I will choose the JS route over the Ruby route, but not sure yet. Next commits will show more?
