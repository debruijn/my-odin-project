// Plan:
// - Get container reference
// - Create square divs and add to container as a 4x4 grid (or flexible?)
// - Use flexbox in specifying how to show them
// - Add the hover effect to change the color when mouse pointer moves over a grid
// - Allow for overwrite of grid with new grid based on numeric input
// - Make grid random color when going through grid
// - Make square darker by 10%
